# Two-Pass-Assembler
Overview
This is a two-pass assembler written using PYTHON. It takes assembly language as input in a file named Input.txt and generates corresponding machine code in a file named outputMCode.txt. Symbol table and Opcode table are generated and displayed in the terminal. Errors in assembly code, if any, will be reported in the terminal. Until all errors are resolved, the program will not generate machine code or symbol/opcode table.
